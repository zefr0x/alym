## Bug report
For now [GitHub Bug Traker](https://github.com/zer0-x/moadaly/issues) is used for this project.

## Development
- The `stable` [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language is used mainly in this project.
- Dependencies managment and building is handled using [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/).

### Style
- You should document every thing to keep the code easy for reading. Every file, every function and any line that need a comment.

To make every thing easy [**`pre-commit`**](https://pre-commit.com/) is used in this project, it should run in every commit, so you shouldn't commit any thing without checking it first.
